### In this repository:
This repository contains a collection of mods for the RK Royal Kludge RKS70  split keyboard.
- Left and Right mating sections
	- Allows you to build your own mods for this keyboard
- 0 degree connector with space for 3dconnexion Space Mouse Compact

### Background Story:
I wanted to wet my feet with the ergo mechanical keyboards before I made my own. I think the RKS70 is a good keyboard to start with. Value and build are pretty good. My main goal was to try to get a useful build to include my spacemouse and eventually a trackball. Still needs some work but I'm fine with how it works so far.
